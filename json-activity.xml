    <abstract>
      <t>The Activity Streams API Specification is designed to make it easy
      for developers transmit and receive activities about a subject in a
      secure and platform agnostic fashion.</t>

      <t>The focus on simplicity and legibility has driven us to model this
      API as a <xref target="REST"></xref>(RESTful) endpoint which emits <xref
      target="JSON"></xref></t>
    </abstract>

      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>This specification describes how to model, transmit, receive and
      parse activities using a simple, secure, generic <xref
      target="REST"></xref> endpoint. Activities are modeled according to the
      concepts defined in Section 3 of <xref
      target="Atom Activity Extensions 1.0"></xref></t>

      <t>Before you get started, we recommend you review the <xref
      target="Example"></xref></t>
    </section>

    <section title="Activity Workflow">
      <t>The very first step is to find the Activity Streams endpoint. A
      Consumer wishing to access a user's Activity Stream can start with an
      Initial Identifier for the Service Provider containing the user's data,
      usually provided by the user. In most cases, this may be the domain name
      of the Service Provider's web site, such as bestsite.com. Consumers can
      then perform Discovery on the Initial Identifier to determine where the
      Activity Streams endpoint for this Service Provider resides. If
      successful, the Consumer may then attempt to request information from
      that endpoint. If the endpoint contains private data, the Service
      Provider will return an authorization challenge, and the Consumer must
      then guide the user through an appropriate authorization flow to obtain
      the credentials necessary to access this private data. Upon successful
      authorization, the Consumer may request data from the Activity Streams
      endpoint using these authorization credentials. Whether accessing public
      or private data, Consumers may request a specific subset of the user's
      data using standard Query Parameters. Upon a successful request, the
      data is returned in the response, and the Consumer may then parse the
      response data and use it as desired.</t>

      <t>If the Consumer wishes to maintain an in sync copy of the data or get
      new activities as soon as they are available POSTed to them via web
      hooks they should subscribe via the <xref
      target="Auth-API-Push 0.1"></xref></t>

      <t>The following sections detail each of these steps.</t>

      <section title="Discovery">
        <t>Providers who support this specification SHOULD promote their
        conformance by making the Activity Stream API endpoint discoverable
        from the root of the domain using <xref target="XRD 1.0"></xref>. The
        API is identified by the Service Type <spanx style="verb">http://activitystrea.ms/api/0.1</spanx>
        In addition, the url for the Activity Streams end point MUST be
        documented for human consumption by the Service Provider in their API
        documentation. The documentation MUST include the version of the
        Activity Streams API supported. The current version is 0.1</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Retrieval of Activities">
        <t>All content fetching requests to the Service Provider are made as
        HTTP GET operations on a URL deriving form the base URL described in
        section 2.1. Consumers MAY append additional path information and/or
        query string parameters to the Base URL as part of the request, as
        specified in section 5.1 [TODO] Additionally, authentication
        information MUST be sent using OAuth 2.0 Protocol as defined in <xref
        target="OAuth 2.0"></xref> for protected resources. For details on
        declaring the end point as a protected resource see section 6 of <xref
        target="OAuth 2.0"></xref></t>
      </section>

      <section title="Authentication and Authorization">
        <t>The activities returned from the Activity Stream endpoint MAY
        contain a mix of public and private data. [TODO: Example]. If Service
        Providers wish to make some response data publicly available and also
        provide additional info given the proper authorization credentials,
        they SHOULD provide a 200 OK response to requests without
        authorization with a WWW-Authenticate header in the response
        indicating that additional info is available via the specified
        authorization mechanisms.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Synchronization">
        <t>In order to keep the data synchronized it is possible to repeatedly
        invoke the Activity Streams endpoint using GET and passing
        if-modified-since headers. This concept is known as polling and it is
        not considered the most efficient for keeping multiple repositories of
        data in synch. The Activity Streams endpoint SHOULD support
        subscriptions so consumers can enjoy near real time updates without
        much expense using <xref target="Auth-API-Push 0.1"></xref></t>
      </section>

      <section title="Creation of Activities">
        <t>This section describes how activities by an external generator on
        behalf of the user on a given Service Provider. All content creation
        requests to the Service Provider are made as HTTP POST operations on
        the base URL described in section 2.1. Additionally, authentication
        information MUST be sent using OAuth 2.0 Protocol as defined in <xref
        target="OAuth 2.0"></xref>. For details on declaring the end point as
        a protected resource see section 6 of <xref
        target="OAuth 2.0"></xref></t>

        <t>The Activity Streams endpoint can also be invoked using POST to
        create new activity entries on the Service Provider TODO: Add more
        details</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Types">
