      <t>NOTE WELL: This is a very early draft which may change drastically
      and incompatibly in subsequent revisions.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Types">
      <t>The following sections define the different types that represent
      concepts from the activity streams data model in JSON.</t>

      <section title="Activity">
        <t>An Activity represents an activity as defined by the Activity
        Streams specifications.</t>

        <t>An Activity has the following properties:</t>

        <t><list style="hanging">
            <t hangText="verbs (array&lt;string&gt;)">The list of verb URIs
            for this activity. These verbs MUST all be generalizations or
            specializations of one another, and they MUST be specified in
            order from least specific to most specific. This property MUST NOT
            be <spanx style="verb">null</spanx> and the list MUST contain at
            least one item.</t>

            <t hangText="object (Object)">The object of this activity. This
            property MUST NOT be <spanx style="verb">null</spanx>.</t>

            <t hangText="target (Object)">The target of this activity. This
            property MUST be <spanx style="verb">null</spanx> if the activity
            has no target.</t>

            <t hangText="actor (Object)">The actor of this activity. This
            property MUST NOT be <spanx style="verb">null</spanx>.</t>

            <t hangText="postedTime (string)">The time that the activity
            occurred, as a W3CDTF timestamp. This property MUST NOT be <spanx
            style="verb">null</spanx>.</t>

            <t hangText="id (string)">A URI that serves as an identifier for
            this activity. This property MUST NOT be <spanx style="verb">null</spanx>.</t>

           <t hangText="permalinkUrl (string)">The URL of a HTML page that
            represents this activity. This property SHOULD NOT be <spanx
            style="verb">null</spanx>.</t>
			
			<t hangText="streamFaviconUrl (string)">The URL of an icon represents this activity. 
				This property MAY be <spanx style="verb">null</spanx> if there are no specific icons per activity type for this activity publisher</t>

            <t hangText="title (string)">An HTML representation of the natural
            language title for this activity. Consumers MAY use the
            value of this field, if set, as a fallback for when none of the
            provided verbs are recognized. This property MAY be <spanx
            style="verb">null</spanx> if the publisher does not wish to
            provide a HTML representation.</t>
			<t hangText="body (string)">An HTML representation of a natural
            language describing this activity including visual elements such as thumbnails. 
			Consumers MAY use the value of this field, if set, as a fallback for when none of the
            provided verbs are recognized. This property MAY be <spanx
            style="verb">null</spanx> if the publisher does not wish to
            provide a HTML representation.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>If additional properties are present in an Activity, they MUST be
        ignored.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Object">
        <t>Object is the base type of objects that can be referenced by
        activities. Specific object types will extend this basic object with
        additional properties that are specific to the object type in
        question.</t>

        <t>All Object types have the following properties:</t>

        <t><list style="hanging">
            <t hangText="displayName (string)">A name that can be used to
            refer to this object when none of its types are recognised. The
            meaning of this field may be refined further for particular object
            types. This property MUST NOT be <spanx style="verb">null</spanx>.</t>

            <t hangText="permalinkURL (string)">The URL of a HTML page that
            represents this object. This property SHOULD NOT be <spanx
            style="verb">null</spanx>.</t>

			<t hangText="picture (string)">The URL to a pictorial representation of the object.</t>

            <t hangText="objectTypes (array&lt;string&gt;)">The list of object
            type URIs for this object. These object types MUST all be
            generalizations or specializations of one another, and they MUST
            be specified in order from least specific to most specific. This
            property MUST NOT be <spanx style="verb">null</spanx> and the list
            MUST contain at least one item.</t>

            <t hangText="id (string)">A URI that serves as an identifier for
            this activity stream. This property MUST NOT be <spanx
            style="verb">null</spanx>.</t>

			<t hangText="summary (string)">A human readable snippet of the content suitable for display on a browser.
				 This property MAY be <spanx style="verb">null</spanx></t>
				
			<t hangText="content (string)">A human readable version of the entire content suitable for display on a browser.
				 This property MAY be <spanx style="verb">null</spanx></t>

            <t hangText="published (string)">The time that this object was
            published, as a W3CDTF timestamp. This property MUST NOT be <spanx
            style="verb">null</spanx>.</t>

            <t hangText="updated (string)">The time that this object was most
            recently updated, as a W3CDTF timestamp. This property MAY be
            <spanx style="verb">null</spanx>, in which case the last updated
            time is not known.</t>
          </list></t>
      </section>

      <section title="ActivityStream">
        <t>An activity stream is a collection of activities. Often these
        activities are related in some way, such as being by the same
        actor.</t>

        <t>An ActivityStream has the following properties:</t>

        <t><list style="hanging">
            <t hangText="displayName (string)">A human-readable name for this
            stream. This property MAY be <spanx style="verb">null</spanx> if
            the stream has no name.</t>

            <t hangText="entries (array&lt;Activity&gt;)">The activities
            comprising this stream. This property MUST NOT be <spanx
            style="verb">null</spanx>.</t>

            <t hangText="id (string)">A URI that serves as an identifier for
            this activity stream. This property MUST NOT be <spanx
            style="verb">null</spanx>.</t>

            <t hangText="subjectId (string)">If this stream is considered to
            be about a specific object -- usually a Person -- the publisher
            SHOULD include the value of the id property for that object here
            to allow consumers to identify this object when it is referred to
            in properties of the included activities.</t>
